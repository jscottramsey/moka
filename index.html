<h2>Join us for 5 minutes and 28 seconds of meditation.</h2>
<p>As you watch the video below, turn your volume up, shut off other sources of distraction, focus on the image in front of you.  As the coffee is made, pay close attention to all of the visual and auditory changes.  Watch the moisture develop on the side of the moka pot, and watch it evaporate as the pot warms up.  Listen for the sound of the coffee brewing inside as the pressure builds and the coffee is made.  Enjoy the refreshing cup and prepare to continue your day, relaxed and renewed.</p>
